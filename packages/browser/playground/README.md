A collection of examples for showing how to use PostHog's JS SDK, or for testing features of it.

`playground/nextjs` is the most commonly used inside PostHog.

Note: these folders are excluded from the main workspace in this repo. You will need to install dependencies in each folder separately. They are excluded to keep a separation between the dependencies of our production SDKs and misc code examples.
