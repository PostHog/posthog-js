# Implementation Plan: Update README.md with greeting

**Task ID:** c59eefcb-d5ce-4985-a15a-8c22c35752b9  
**Generated:** 2025-10-31

## Summary

Add "hi there" as plain text at the very beginning of the README.md file (before the logo), serving as a casual greeting/welcome message for users. This is a simple text insertion that requires modifying a single file.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Analysis
- [x] Located README.md at `/Users/jonathan/dev/posthog-js/README.md`
- [x] Reviewed current structure: logo/badges start at line 1, followed by title and description
- [x] Confirmed placement: add greeting as first line before existing content

### 2. Changes Required
- [x] Single file modification: README.md
- [x] No dependencies to add or update
- [x] No build or configuration changes required

### 3. Implementation
- [ ] Add "hi there" as the first line of README.md
- [ ] Add blank line after greeting to maintain visual separation from logo
- [ ] Verify Markdown rendering remains intact

## File Changes

### New Files
```
None
```

### Modified Files
```
/Users/jonathan/dev/posthog-js/README.md
- Add "hi there" as line 1
- Add blank line as line 2
- Existing content shifts down by 2 lines
```

## Considerations

**Architectural Decisions:**
- Plain text format preserves simplicity and casual tone
- Placement at the very top ensures visibility as first element readers see
- Blank line after greeting maintains visual hierarchy with existing logo/badge section

**Potential Risks:**
- Minimal risk: simple text addition with no breaking changes
- No impact on documentation links, build processes, or functionality
- Markdown rendering unaffected

**Testing Approach:**
- Visual verification: ensure greeting appears correctly when rendered
- Format check: confirm blank line separation maintains readability
- Link validation: verify existing links and badges remain functional

**Edge Cases:**
- None identified for this simple text addition
